        <p>
            This tasty and low effort goulash recipe is an absolute delight. I use a slow cooking method to reduce
            the time spent in the kitchen while still getting an amazingly flavorful result. This recipe uses some
            of my favorite veggies but you should feel free to swap or add whatever veggies appeal to you.
