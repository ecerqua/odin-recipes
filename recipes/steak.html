        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                This delicious steak recipe is tender and flavorful. Seasoned with simple salt and pepper to preserve the natural flavor of the steak and topped with
                caramelized onion to add some additional flavor and texture. Oven roasted garlic can be placed on the steak or to the side for an additional
                flavor as desired. Caramelizing the onions is a bit time consuming but it is so worth it. Serve with a salad or potatoes for a dinner that is sure to
                impress.
